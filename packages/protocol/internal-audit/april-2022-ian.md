# Internal Audit

## Staking Rewards

### Goal

Break the contract. Get it to do something we wouldn't want it to do.

### Responsibilities of the contract

- Manage accounting and disbursal of GFI for owners of FIDU who stake their FIDU using the contract
- Manage accounting and disbursal of GFI for owners of FIDU-USDC Curve LP tokens who stake those tokens using the contract
- Provide some public view functions that describe this accounting (e.g. for use by the frontend)

### Contract code

NOTE: This audit covers the contract code at the top level; it does NOT cover code inherited from base contracts, except where noted.

        - ISSUE
          - Does amount of `curveLPTokens` have correct mantissa for compatibility with StakingRewards logic?
            - In theory, even if `curveLPTokens` has a different mantissa than FIDU, this differential could be included in the value of the base exchange rate or effective multiplier (probably base exchange rate seems more appropriate).
            - I see this comment:
            ```
            // Curve LP tokens are scaled by MULTIPLIER_DECIMALS (1e18),
            uint256 curveLPVirtualPrice = config.getFiduUSDCCurveLP().get_virtual_price();
            ```
            - I think, given the context, that that comment may be describing the mantissa of the Curve LP token _price_, rather than the token itself?
            - TODO In any case, we should confirm the mantissa of the Curve LP token itself and its price, and include comments that link to that info.

          - We should add a comment explaining why we're so sure of this.
          - What is the main use-case, anyway, where we want the effective multiplier to increase?
          - Note that if we change this invariant, we'll need to also modify the logic for updating `totalStakedSupply`, to prevent underflow error.
          - REMEDY
            - Priority: HIGH
            - Decision: Not a real issue. We want to honor the original multiplier for the user's sake, so we don't want to allow the effective multiplier for a given position to decrease.
    - Fail to set the new effective multiplier correctly
      - Review status
        - OK
    - Fail to update the `totalStakedSupply` correctly
      - Review status
        - BUG
          - Staked positions prior to GIP-1 do not have an `effectiveMultiplier`, so their value is implicitly 0. This results in an incorrect incrementing of `totalStakedSupply`, because the `prevEffectiveAmount` would be 0, so we'd be adding `newEffectiveAmount` to `totalStakedSupply` -- but we don't want to add anything for these tokens, because they're already reflected in `totalStakedSupply`.
          - REMEDY
            - Priority: CRITICAL
            - Write `forceInitializeBaseTokenExchangeRateAndEffectiveMultiplier()` function, and use it in migration, for all existing staked positions.
              - Then could remove `baseTokenExchangeRate == 0` ternary in `toEffectiveAmount()`
              - This isn't the only possible solution, but it probably keeps the contract easiest to reason about, because baseTokenExchangeRate and effectiveMultiplier logic would apply equally well to all tokens

    - Allow non-owner-and-non-zapper of token to perform the unstaking
      - Review status
        - ISSUE
          - Because the Zapper only needs permission to call `unstake()`, it would be more appropriate to move this access-control exception for the Zapper into that function and out of `_unstake()`, so that the Zapper does not have permission to perform all the other unstaking functions which call `_unstake()`.

        - ISSUE
          - If the sender is the Zapper, unvested rewards are not slashed. This is quite a significant exception and deserves an explanation; I am frustrated at the lack of documentation of something like this. I suppose the reason for the exception is: we're just trusting the Zapper, that in whatever it may be doing on behalf of a user for which reason it needs to unstake, that objective is equally valuable to the protocol and so the user deserves to keep earning their original amount of rewards.

- stakedBalanceOf
  - Review status
    - ISSUE
      - This function returns the naked `amount` on the position; it does not convert the amount to an "effective amount". This behavior is not documented. We should call `_positionToEffectiveAmount()` -- and note that this call encounters the BUG noted for `toEffectiveAmount()`.

        - ISSUE
          - REMEDY
            - Priority: HIGH
            - We need to evaluate and decide whether we want to give ourselves the ability to set an effective multiplier as 0, as a meaningful value, for the purpose of effectively terminating the further earning of rewards for a particular position type.
            - Decision: leave as-is
    - Extreme value of multiplier
      - Currently there is no lower bound besides > 0, or upper bound, on the effective multiplier value returned by this function. Is that really what we want?
      - Review status
        - ~~ISSUE~~
          - I think given the simplicity of this function, we're comfortable relying on ourselves to have set the effective multiplier value for a given position type correctly, and caught a mistake in that in tests before doing so.

        - BUG
          - Staked positions prior to GIP-1 do not have an `effectiveMultiplier`, so their value for that is implicitly 0. Which means `_positionToEffectiveAmount()` will return 0 for them everywhere. This breaks: `positionCurrentEarnRate()`, `earnedSinceLastCheckpoint()`
            - This could be fixed by calling `updatePositionEffectiveMultiplier()` for all the existing staked positions before doing the migration...but `updatePositionEffectiveMultiplier()` would have a BUG for those tokens -- see audit of that function.

          - REMEDY
            - Priority: CRITICAL
            - We should evaluate whether we are comfortable fully relying on the base token exchange rate and effective multiplier values having been set correctly "upstream", or whether we'd feel better about imposing a cap on the combined multiplicative effect of those two values.
            - Decision: We are comfortable relying on setting bounds on the base token exchange rate, plus our testing of setting the effective multiplier value.
