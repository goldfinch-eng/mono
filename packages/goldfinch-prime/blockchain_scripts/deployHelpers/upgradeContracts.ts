 * Rewrite a proxy upgrade in the deployments directory. hardhat-deploy creates 3 different deployment files for a proxied contract:
 *
 *   - Contract_Proxy.json. Proxy ABI.
 *   - Contract_Implementation.json. Implementation ABI.
 *   - Contract.json. Combined Proxy and Implementation ABI.
 *
 * When using `hre.deployments.deploy` with the `proxy` key, hardhat-deploy will write out the combined ABI. But since
 * we use a multisig to change the proxy's implementation, only the implementation ABI is written out by hardhat-deploy.
 * Work around this by rewriting the combined ABI ourselves.
